Middle Mars FAQ:

Q. Why isn't this map shaped like most Terraformed Mars maps?
A. This map uses the Azimuthal Equidistant map projection (same map projection as on the United Nations logo) centered on the south pole because most of Mars's landmass is in the southern hemisphere, while most maps in general use a mercator or equirectangular projection centered on the equator and prime meridian.
This map also has a much higher sea level than most depictions of a Terraformed Mars to make more interesting choke points.

Q.How do I get Cybernetics? 

A. Option 1. As a Grace decision through the offmap empire (requires Jade Dragon DLC)
   Option 2. Have a Cywizard in your court or as a direct vassal, have a prisoner with a cybernetic, then right click the prisoner and choose which cybernetic you would like to steal (cost decreases if you follow the Kemetic religion)


Q. How do I perform Genetic Engineering?

A. Have a Cywizard in your court or as a direct vassal, have a child or courtier less than 1 year old, then right click the child and choose which congenital trait you would like added with genetic engineering for a large amount of gold (requirements decrease with tech level, or if you follow the Altered religion).


Q. How do I create Clones?

A. Option 1. As a Grace decision through the offmap empire (requires Jade Dragon DLC), can only clone yourself this way, cannot clone courtiers.
   Option 2 (not yet implemented). Have a Cywizard in your court or as a direct vassal, right click the character you would like to clone and select the Create Clone decision. Has a higher chance of defects than the offmap decision due to using surrogates instead of VAT chambers.


Q. How do I buy a Mech?

A. Either be the Spacer religion, have a liege of the Spacer religion, or have an independent neighbor of the Spacer religion. The decision will then be available in the intrigue decisions menu.


Q. How do I not lose health when using a Mech?

A. You need the Spacer Physiology, Heavy Worlder, genius, or strong trait, otherwise it takes a toll on your health the first time you plug into a Mech.


Q. Why are Mechs so expensive?

A. There is no infrastructure to maintain them on Mars, which makes the cost of keeping them functional astronomical. They are extremely OP to make up for this (they have special battle events in additional to their blanket bonuses), and will be further balanced in future updates.
