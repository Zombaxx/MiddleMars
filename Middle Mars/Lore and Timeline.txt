Middle Mars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long ago, many centuries after Mars had been fully Terraformed, Earth went dark on the same day all electronics on Mars stopped working. All ships not in orbit fell from the sky. 

Mars quickly descended into chaos as society collapsed, bringing on a new Dark Age. Most of the population succumbed to famine as governments broke down and nations fractured. 

Around 1000 years later humanity is recovering and has entered a new Medieval Era, largely forgetting the accurate history of humanity and the disaster. 
No one except the Spacers know if Earth is still around and is thought of as more of a holy icon and legend. Some ideologies reject the concept or existence of Earth as we know it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Timeline as known on Mars in 1066AD:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

550 A.D (After Disaster)
The Seaborne, originating on the Tempe Terra peninsula, have become the scourge of the West, 
constantly raiding everywhere from the Argyre Sea, Valles Marineris, Alba, all the way to Olympus Mons.

Solarist territory extends further into Ceraunius Fossae

650
Seaborne conquer Alba, but most of the existing peasant population remains Singularitan. 
The Alban Warlord religion, a violent Singularitan heresy with a nearly opposite interpretation of The Texts, forms as a response,
and are ultimately able to expel the Seaborne back to the peninsula of Tempe Terra, with constant flux near the border.

700
Alba is a mix of Singularitan and Alban Warlords.

800
The Solarists are pushed out of Ceraunius Fossae by the Alban Warlords

889
Xander the Great is born, and goes on to form both the Olympian Empire

916
Xander the Great conquers Alba for the Olympian Empire

938
Xander the Great dies, the Olympian Empire is left to his son, Phillipos

946
The Olympian Empire loses the Alba region to the Alban Warlords (a violent Singularitan Heresy) with the help of Valles Marineris.

960-975
Valles Marineris' influence over the region grows, most Alban Warlords quickly convert to Singularitan in a time of relative peace.

998
The Spacers, a group of celestial travelers sent from the stars, arrive at the Tharsis Montes Space Elevator. Due to having spent their entire lives in artificial gravity, 
they are unable to survive on the gravity well of a world without special gravity acclimating drugs which are in short supply due to the destruction of most fabricators aboard their only colony spaceship. 
A large portion of their population must forever remain in space and be provided with the resources necessary to survive in exchange for the few goods that the remaining fabricators could still produce: Cybernetics and Mechs. 
At first those that set surface on Mars were seen as angels descended from Sol by the natives, and unified the many Solarian tribes with the help of their mechanical beast, the Mech. 

999
The Solarians soon became aware that their new celestial rulers are from a star other than Sol, and are thus demons rather than angels. 
Most of the "demon" Spacers were driven back by the Solarians in open rebellion, who destroyed the ancient and once holy entrance to the space elevator with the help of the Cywizards. 
The remaining Spacers in Tharsis managed to band together and begin to retake control over the Solarians.

1000
Spacers Arrive at the Planum Australe Space Elevator and begin settling the peninsula of Promethi Terra  on the north side of the Hellas Sea, Cyborg Prisoners escape. 
Basic farming technologies spead across Mars, creating a population boom across the planet.

1040
The Spacers remaining in Tharsis Montes, extremely far and disconnected from the primary colony of Spacers in Planum Australe, manage to retake the kingdom and the derelict space elevator. 
Their new leader quickly becomes known as the Demon King, who hopes to repair the space elevator as quickly as possible to contact their people and gain access to their colony spaceship, 
but the Solarians have plans of his demise. The necessary repairs will take decades at best, perhaps centuries.

1042
The Great Schism of the Singularitan religion occurs in the Western Hemisphere in the regions between Valles Marines and Mount Alba, branching off into the separate faiths of Holy Terra and Blessed Singularity. 
Valles Marineris loses influence over the Mount Alba region, the greater Singulariton region becomes unstable.

1061
Valles Marineris loses Western Argyre, a crown-jewel of the Empire, to a Noachian invasion stemming from across the sea with hopes of conquering and 
repairing the Ancient Terraforming Machines to stop the atmosphere from fading away, to stop an impending apocalypse the Noachians believe would end all life on the planet.

1062 
The Remnant, a small island republic of diverse religions in the middle of the Argyre Sea, praises itself as the last beacon of democracy and the old ways of governance, but faces uncertainty 
while their biggest customer the long staple Valles Marineris Empire, crumbles and loses control of West Argyre to Noachis Terra, causing essential trade routes to break down and require re-establishment.
Now with both sides of the Argyre Sea controlled by the newly united Noachian-Terraformed Empire, will the Remnant be able to maintain their liberty?
Democratically elected leaders of the Remnant follow the old, just ways of serving for life, or until removal by faction majority demand, once votes have been counted. 
While the most respected candidate should generally win in theory, campaign donations, lobbying, and mercenary limits are unrestricted meaning the five corporate families are the only viable candidates.

1064
Valles Marineris loses the western half of their empire in a civil war

1066
Valles Marineris is attacked by Noachis Terra yet again, and the remaining eastern half of the empire (Noctis Fossae) uses this 
as an opportunty to start a war of cessation, with only central Valles Marineris staying loyal

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lore:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A large variety of animals were brought to Mars for stable ecosystems, animal husbandry, and farming. Many were genetically engineered to enhance or adapt their function to better thrive on Mars. When the disaster happened some of the more experimental/dangerous species escaped into the wild

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Western Argyre, a longtime staple of the Blessed Singularity Valles Marineris Empire, has been conquered by the Terraformed who sailed across the Argyrian Sea from Noachis Terra. 

The Empire stands in shambles, having also ceded their north-eastern territory in an independence revolt. To the south lies scattered pagan tribals, to the west the competing Catholic (Holy Terran) Empire of Noctis Fossae which seaks to unite the disorganized lands between itself and the kingdoms of North and South Alba in order to become the uncontested regional power. 

The Kingdom of North Alba is ruled by the Blessed Singularity, alone in a sea of Holy Terra faithful, and is constantly on the verge of war with their neighbors the Kingdom of South Alba. Both kingdoms remain unstable due to the rulers not being the same culture as their vassals. 
Above Alba Mons, in Tempe Terra, are Germanic Kingdoms, and deep within Solis Planum, south of the Valles Marineris Sea, some say is a great Animist Kingdom. 

The Hellenic Kingdom of Mount Olympus is on it's way to unification, but sees pagan kingdoms of similar size creeping in from fellow Hellenics in Gigas Sulci, and Zunists in Tharsis Montes, and the Cyclics on the Daedalian Planum. 

Beyond Tharsis Mons and the Daedalian Planum are Altered agents plotting entry into the western regions, nomads squabbling among themselves, though who could potentially became an unstoppable threat if they were ever managed to be united. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suddenly the Spacers from the Tau Ceti star system arrive in the Sol System to investigate in the wake of the Great Disaster. Because the majority of their fleet had been destroyed during the Long Voyage, most of their resources and infrastructure needed for long term survival had been lost, and the Spacers were forced to settle as many of their people near the space elevator in Planum Australe as possible. 
Unfortunately most of the Spacer population must remain in orbit because Spacers cannot acclimate to the gravity of a planet without special acclimating drugs which were in limited supply on the remaining ship,  and must begin trading their remaining cybernetics and mech suits through the space elevator for food and supplies. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cywizards:
Many of the Elite of Tau Ceti receive full cybernetic conversions not only to dramatically enhance their abilities, but also to extend their lifespans to near immortal. 
Spacers are generally the working class of the Tau Ceti star system which are unable to adapt to gravity without special gravity acclimating drugs due to living their entire lives in low gravity. High gravity without these acclimating drugs would be tortuous or fatal. 
While Spacers often have minor cybernetics, it is extremely rare that a Spacer would ever become affluent enough in Tau Ceti to receive a full cybernetic conversion.

Spacers mutinied against the elite Cyborgs sometime during the ~900 year voyage to Sol from Tao Ceti, but many cyborgs escaped to courts across Mars on the surviving ship’s arrival (most of the fleet was disabled or destroyed before reaching Sol. Whether the mutiny was the cause or result of the fleet’s destruction is up for debate).
Basically anti spacer immortal wizards with high stats. Staying conscious for nearly 1000 years can make you crazy, so many of them were placed in artificial comas for long periods of the voyage.

Cryogenically freezing, like light travel, does not exist, so the Spacers had been the working class crew, and eventual colonists or soldiers, that the elite Cyborgs needed. The ship containing most of the medicine needed for Spacers to acclimate to gravity, and most of the supplies and tools needed for the mission itself, were lost. Most Spacers are left stuck in space with dwindling food, resources, and few tools (beyond the cybernetic and mech manufacturing facilities most other fabricators and resources were on the destroyed ships of the fleet), which is why the off map ship must continue trading advanced tech with whoever it can on Mars. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moments before the Spacers first arrived to take young Tara’s people away from the desolate remains of Earth, her father,  King of the Survivors, had been murdered in cold blood by his brother in-law, Kane. 
Years later, once the Spacers had begun settling the shores of Promethei Terra, the Earthers were given a small island of their own in the Hellas Sea. Much to her horror, leadership was given to her treaturous uncle in-law instead to Tara, the rightful ruler of the Survivors. 
This made it an easy choice when a mysterious metallic man, dubiously claiming to be her distant relative, asked her to accompany him to western Tharsis Rise, a land where Earth is venerated, and claim her place among them as a true Earther and therefor the rightful ruler of the Holy Terran faithful. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Children of the sky, a cultural group stretching from the southern edge of the Daedalia Planum to Planum Australe, are descendants of passengers from a very large Sol cruise ship that was spared from the electronic frying blast of the Great Disaster because one of the gas giants blocked most of the radiation, and their ship was in the perfect spot to not be disabled. 
They scavenged food from wreckage the best they could for generations, but eventually there were no more resources to keep the ship running (their ship did not include advanced fabricators, and any fabricator they found while scavenging was fried. Food was frozen though and could be deradiated).
There was no way to safely transport everyone to Mars with the ship in tact, so they landed the entire failing ship on Mars best they could.
The only full-cyborg natively from the Sol System (and from before the disaster) is an insane character from this culture. All other Sol Cyborgs would have been fried during the Great Disaster. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the majority of Holy Terra adherents within Western Argyre had long been happy at the prospect of parting ways with the misguided Blessed Singularity Valles Marineris Empire, takeover by blasphemous Terraformed overlords was the last way any self-respecting Singularitan wanted it to occur. 
They began plotting in secret to take back Western Argyre for Holy Terra, a feat that had long remained a pipe-dream since the missionaries first spread the true faith to Argyre shortly before  the rise of the Valles Marineris Empire and the schism between Holy Terra and Blessed Singularity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Spacer leaders in orbit around Mars had not been honest about what they had found on Earth. They had taken a vault of survivors who had been convinced the rest of Earth had been destroyed, and had chosen to tell that story to their constituents to forward their own agenda after learning that a second ship controlled by the Cywizards survived the Spacer coup during the Great Voyage to investigate Sol in the wake of the Great Disaster and landed on Earth beyond the Great Wall. The leaders of the newly free Spacer peoples had then chosen to instead settle the other garden planet, Mars, and lie to their people about Earth’s fate and the second surviving ship for the greater good of their ideology and future of their people.

Shortly after the Doom on Earth that destroyed the governments and knowledge of old, the transformation occurred, pulling the cold winds further down from the north and mountain peaks, while pushing out the seas causing a shift in the location of biomes, disrupting the farming and trading of the fleeting remnants of civilization. 
The ancient cities that were not destroyed in the Great War were abandoned in mass migrations as their harbors became dry, becoming colossal ghost towns of metal, a legacy of the past, occasionally occupied by tribals or nomads.

The Western Pacific was facing away from the Doom that ended the civilizations of old. While the entire world was devastated, the Western Pacific was able to recover quicker, entering the medieval era while the survivors in other parts of the planet still struggled to survive the consequences of the apocalypse.

Song about Middle Mars by Гыгль:
Where There Is No Peace And Only War

"Mars, boundless red earth
Where everything is forgotten
The world is forgotten, the Earth is forgotten
Only war, and only it

War on all fronts
All you need is an excuse
Any reason, just an excuse
War and only war

Everyone is fighting for who knows what
War without romance, war without love
The lands are rising to make war
Everyone worships her,
Gradually destroying yourself

War and only war,
War on all fronts
The whole world is covered by it
War for war's sake

Mars in red fire
Everything is forgotten, the Earth is forgotten
Everyone worships her
Gradually destroying yourself!"

TOP SECRET (SPOILERS, Timeline as known by the Spacers and Cywizards 1492 years After the Disaster)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The background surrounding the Great Disaster 1000 years ago should remain mysterious to the player. This is mainly provided as an explanation of the mod’s setting, and a background for event writing, 
though keep in mind no characters in game know what happened before year 0, and only the Spacers and  Cywizards know what happened between 24-1000 outside of their own local regions for the most part.
BD stands for Before Disaster, AD stands for After Disaster. 


~10,000-1,000 BD (Before Disaster)
Spacers are treated as a sub-human working class. Most of them live in poverty. Air is worth more than titanium in Spacer residences. Most are malnourished. 
The Spacer working class enables large scale infrastructure, manufacturing, and mining in space, propelling planet bound humans to new heights of civilization.

Mars becomes fully terraformed. Despite being terraformed most of Mars’ land area is vast desert which is not suited to life. 
Studies show that increasing Mars’s sea level with the use of ice comets would increase the livable area substantially, but the Earth government is opposed to this as it would destroy most infrastructure 
on Mars, crippling profits and development in the short term despite the obvious benefits in the long term. Mars continues developing along the coast with a low sea level.

The Tau Ceti Star System is colonized.

Full Cybernetic Conversions are invented. Although individuals with these conversions can technically live forever, in practice they will go insane and die within several hundered years of being conscious,
so it is common to induce temporary suspended conciousness for long periods of time to extend the period before this occurs.

200BD Overpopulation and poverty across the Solar System skyrockets, beginning a new era

10BD: Spacer Eco Terrorists bombard Mars with ice comets to increase sea level, because despite the destruction it would cause a much greater land area to be inhabitable in the future, 
ending overpopulation and drastically reducing poverty in the solar system, thus saving their people. This had been proposed by scientists and humanitarians for years and refused by the UE (United Earth, 
the primary federal government in the Solar System) due to the infrastructure and profits it would destroy in the short term. Many lives would have been saved if the planet had been safely evacuated first, 
but the benefits outweighed the loss of life in the Terrorists’ eyes.

The UE responds with genocide of Spacers, eventually escalating into genocide of all those opposed to the UE and becoming facist. All non-government/non-military communications to and from Earth are blocked. 

5BD: Earth is bombarded heavily with a variety of comets in response to end the attacks against non-Terrans, leaving very little habitable farming land. Fallout Style UE bunker is the only survivor.

0AD: Great Disaster. The UE (United Earth) detonates the secret solar weapon as a last resort which fries all tech in the solar system to end the war, and sends the solar system back to the Stone Age.

24AD: Tau Ceti detects that the Solar System has gone dark, and begins speculating and preparing.

50AD:  Tau Ceti’s voyage to investigate the Solar System begins.

~100-1000AD: Spacers aboard the Long Voyage win a revolt against their Elite Tao Ceti cyborg overlords (known on Mars as Cywizards), most had remained in suspended conciousness for the long journey and had been left defenseless. 
They decide to take some of them prisoner instead of executing due to their vast knowledge. The leader of the Cyborgs is executed, but his clone son Kai survives.

Most of the massive UE bunker beneath the surface of Earth becomes compromised, ultimately only a single family survives.

1000AD: Spacers Arrive at the Planum Australe Space Elevator and begin settling, Cyborg Prisoners escape. Basic farming technologies spead across Mars, creating a population boom across the planet.

1051 Tara Carter is born on Earth

1065 John Carter is killed by Kane Smith on Earth, and Spacers “rescue” Earthers ((to use as body guards due to Spacers being physically very weak, while Earthers are physically much stronger than Martians 
and stand a better chance against Cywizards). They initially hadn’t bothered 65 years earlier because Earth was in a much worse state than Mars). After arrival on Mars, 
Tara escapes from Kane with Kai the Cywizard to the Noctis Fossae Empire, where Kai is able to convince the NF Emperor to give Tara a small holding near the capital so that 
“holy” Earthers have their own refuge within Holy Terra. He also convinced the NF Emperor that Tara has claims to all other Holy Terra kingdoms outside his Empire, with 
the Emperor’s gift to Tera being what exonerated him from Tara gaining claims on his land.

1066 Start

1067 Noachis Terra takes over Southern Marineris from The Valles Marineris Empire

1100 Tara converts to Holy Terra (secretly remaining Mother Earth) and forms the Holy Terran Empire, comprised of north Alba, south Alba, and Ceraunius Fossae.

1121 The Holy Terran Empire crumbles with Tara’s death, but Holy Terra is greatly strengthened and there are more major independent kingdoms in the Western Hemisphere than before. 
Kai is imprisoned by the emperor of Noctis Fossae after attempting a coup for Tara’s heir.

1389 Kai inherits the Holy Terran Empire, which had eventually been reformed by Tara’s descendants. Kai is falsely considered a Demi-God and ancient ancestor to Tara’s dynasty.

1492 After several unsuccessful attempts, Kai successfully invades Planum Australe and takes the space elevator, gaining access to the spaceship. 
He is able to repair an advanced fabricator which was broken during the Spacer revolt long ago, and thus begins repairing the space ship with the tools created using the fabricator. 

After departing the gravity of Mars he is quickly intercepted by a Spacer fleet, soon learning that they were a different faction of the rebellion 
which had been separated and driven off course after the Spacer victory, arriving to the Solar System generations later than the spaceship he had arrived on nearly 500 years ago.

The Spacer Fleet confiscates Kai's spaceship and decides to let him live in exchange for vital resources that the fleet needs to survive, offers a ferry service for Kai's armies to 
the other terraformed worlds of the Solar System to grow his empire, but warns him that space travel will forever be a monopology of the illustrious Spacers Guild,  
and that he is now in service to the Celestial if he ever wishes to have ambitions beyond Mars again.

A second smaller Spacer offshoot faction establishes operations in the Solar System and begins piracy and raiding operations across the many worlds, leaving the Space Pirates and the Spacer Fleet
as the only groups capable of space travel. The Pirates and Spacer fleet seldom attack each others' ships directly due to the ships being indiscernible to each other when in motion and the pirates easily blending in when needed.
Those that become enemies of the Spacers Guild can often find passage to other worlds with the help of the treacherous Pirates, but neither Spacer faction will work with barbaric ideologies until they reform their practices.

Kai learns that his Cywizard clone brother that he was separated from during the Spacer Rebellion survived, and has convinced one of the most powerful empires on Earth that he is a mythical figure from legends that has returned to rule them. 
With both Cywizard brothers having control of empires on separate worlds, and with interplanetary travel opening up between the many terraformed yet feudal worlds of the Solar System, what will the future hold for humanity? Find out in the upcoming Cyber Kings: Solar System mod.
